        Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
        You were practicing a magic trick
        And my thoughts got rude, as you talked and chewed
        On the last of your pick and mix
        Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking that I haven't been called "cold" before"
        As you bit into your strawberry lace
        And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
        Is all you had left and it was going to waste
        Your pastimes, consisted of the strange

        And twisted and deranged
        And I love that little game you had called
        "Crying Lightning"
        And how you like to aggravate the ice-cream man on rainy afternoons
        The next time that I caught my own reflection
        It was on it's way to meet you
        Thinking of excuses to postpone
        You never looked like yourself from the side
        But your profile could not hide

        The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
        With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
        Stood and puffed your chest out like you never lost a war
        And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of a reaction
        There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
        And your pastimes, consisted of the strange
        And twisted and deranged
        And I hate that little game you had called

        "Crying Lightning"
        And how you like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
        Uninviting
        But not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
        Crying lightning
        And your pastimes, consisted of the strange
        And twisted and deranged
        
        And I hate that little game you had called
        "Crying Lightning"
        "Crying Lightning"
        "Crying Lightning"
        "Crying Lightning"
        Your pastimes, consisted of the strange
        And twisted and deranged
        And I hate that little game you had called
        "Crying"
